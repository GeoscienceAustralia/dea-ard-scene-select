Module creation
---------------
Modules are built of the develop branch. Create an annotated tag to tag a module build.
e.g.

    git tag -a "ard-scene-select-py3-dea/20201126" -m "my version 20201126"


Production modules must be built as the `lpgs` user. This can be done using this sandbox;

    /home/547/lpgs/sandbox/dea-ard-scene-select

To produce the module run this script;

    dea-ard-scene-select/modules/go.sh

Change `echo "dea_module_dir = ${dea_module_dir:=/g/data/v10/public/modules}"` to change the destination location of the module.

To update the .env files used in production manually git pull from the production branch at this location;

   /g/data/v10/projects/c3_ard/dea-ard-scene-select/
